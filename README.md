## Project Description:

The COVID-19 pandemic has not only posed significant health challenges but has also led to an unprecedented surge in information dissemination through social media platforms. In this context, sentiment analysis of COVID-19-related tweets has emerged as a crucial tool for understanding public perceptions, sentiments, and emotions during the pandemic. This report presents a comprehensive analysis of sentiment in COVID-19 tweets using machine learning techniques.

The study utilizes a diverse range of machine learning models, including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Random Forest, to classify sentiments expressed in COVID-19 tweets. A detailed comparison of these models is provided, highlighting their respective strengths and weaknesses in capturing the nuances of sentiment expressed in social media discourse.

The dataset comprises three distinct COVID-19 Twitter datasets collected at different time intervals, enabling temporal analysis of sentiment trends during various phases of the pandemic. Text preprocessing techniques, including data cleaning, tokenization, and normalization, are employed to enhance the quality of the textual data before model training and evaluation.

Results indicate varying performance metrics across different models, with SVM and Random Forest demonstrating higher accuracy and F1 scores compared to Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression. Additionally, the report discusses the impact of dataset characteristics, such as data imbalance and noise, on model performance.

Overall, this study contributes to the growing body of research on sentiment analysis of COVID-19 tweets, providing insights into public sentiments, concerns, and perceptions during a global health crisis. The findings have implications for public health communication, crisis management, and the development of effective interventions to combat misinformation and promote mental well-being during pandemics.â€ƒ
